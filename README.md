## **1. Project Title**
**Blockchain-Based Certificate Verification System**

---

## **2. Project Overview**
Provide a concise summary that encapsulates the essence of your project.

**Example:**
Developed a decentralized certificate verification system leveraging blockchain technology and NFTs to ensure the authenticity and tamper-proof storage of digital certificates. The system enables easy verification through unique identifiers and integrates IPFS for decentralized storage, enhancing security and transparency.

---

## **3. Problem Statement**
Explain the problem your project aims to solve.

**Example:**
Traditional certificate verification methods are susceptible to forgery and inefficiencies in validation processes. There is a need for a secure, transparent, and decentralized system that can reliably verify the authenticity of certificates without relying on centralized authorities.

---

## **4. Objectives**
List the goals you aimed to achieve with this project.

- **Security:** Ensure certificates are tamper-proof and securely stored.
- **Transparency:** Provide a transparent verification process accessible to all stakeholders.
- **Decentralization:** Utilize blockchain and decentralized storage to eliminate single points of failure.
- **User-Friendly:** Create an intuitive interface for easy certificate issuance and verification.

## **5. Approaches and Methodologies**
Detail the different approaches you took, including iterations based on feedback.

### **Approach 1: Without NFT**
- **Process:**
  - Converted certificates to blobs (Binary Large Objects).
  - Applied SHA-256 hashing to blobs.
  - Stored hashes on the blockchain.
  - Mapped hashes with corresponding blobs in MongoDB.
- **Loopholes Identified:**
  - Similar to traditional web2 methods.
- **Jury Feedback:**
  - Recommended integrating NFTs for enhanced functionality and uniqueness.

### **Approach 2: With UUID (Universally Unique Identifier)**
- **Process:**
  - Assigned a unique UUID to each certificate based on name, organization, event, timestamp, and a random component.
  - Embedded UUID in the certificate for easy verification.
  - Uploaded certificates to IPFS, obtaining a CID (IPFS hash).
  - Stored metadata on Pinata, generating a tokenURI.
  - Developed smart contracts to mint NFTs with tokenURI, recipient address, and tokenID.
  - Mapped tokenID with UUID for verification.
- **Verification Process:**
  - Users enter UUID and required details.
  - System retrieves tokenID from UUID, fetches metadata, and validates entered details.
- **Loopholes Identified:**
  - UUID redundancy; tokenID could suffice.
- **Jury Feedback:**
  - Suggested eliminating UUIDs and leveraging tokenIDs directly from the NFT Marketplace.
  - Recommended storing certificates on organizational wallet addresses.

### **Approach 3: Without UUID**
- **Process:**
  - Implemented jury suggestions by removing UUIDs.
  - Directly used tokenIDs from NFTs for certificate identification.
  - Organized certificates within each organization's wallet on the NFT Marketplace.
- **Outcome:**
  - Streamlined verification process.
  - Enhanced alignment with decentralized principles.

## **8. Implementation Details**
Dive deeper into how each component interacts within the system.

- **Certificate Issuance:**
  - Certificates are created and converted into blobs.
  - Blobs are hashed using SHA-256 and stored on the blockchain as NFTs.
  - Metadata, including certificate details, is stored on IPFS via Pinata, and tokenURI is generated.

- **Verification Process:**
  - Users input the tokenID obtained from the NFT Marketplace.
  - The system retrieves the corresponding metadata from IPFS.
  - Verified details are compared to ensure authenticity.

- **User Interface:**
  - Developed with ReactJS, allowing organizations to issue certificates and users to verify them seamlessly.
  - Integrated MetaMask for blockchain interactions and transactions.

## **9. Challenges and Solutions**
Highlight the obstacles you encountered and how you overcame them.

- **Initial Similarity to Web2:**
  - **Challenge:** First approach resembled traditional web2 methods, lacking the benefits of decentralization.
  - **Solution:** Transitioned to using NFTs and decentralized storage to enhance security and uniqueness.

- **Redundancy of UUIDs:**
  - **Challenge:** UUIDs added unnecessary complexity without significant benefits.
  - **Solution:** Adopted tokenIDs from NFTs directly, simplifying the verification process.

- **Ensuring Decentralization:**
  - **Challenge:** Maintaining a fully decentralized system required careful integration of blockchain and IPFS.
  - **Solution:** Utilized IPFS for storage and smart contracts for decentralized control, ensuring no single point of failure.
